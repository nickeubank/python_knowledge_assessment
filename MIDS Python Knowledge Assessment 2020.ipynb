    "\n",
    "This is not a test; it is a diagnostic knowledge assessment. It's purpose is to see (a) whether you should skip Practical Data Science, and (b) if not, what you have absorbed from summer coursework so I know what to emphasize in my course this fall. To accomplish this, the assessment includes questions that cover much of the material that will be covered in Practical Data Science -- material you were *not* taught over the summer. \n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are designed to identify students with prior experience with Python who don't need to take Practical Data Science, so I don't expect most students to be able to do those portion of the exam. I don't think it would be unreasonable for a student without prior Python experience who worked hard this summer to only correctly answer about 30% of the questions here -- and that's **fine!**. Again, the point of this assessment is not to grade you, but rather to help me figure out what you know so that I can tailor my course materials *to meet you where you are*, and best support your training moving forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "That also means that if you don't know how to do something, **please don't spend all your time trying to figure it out!**. There *will* be questions you don't know how to do, so when you find one, just move on!"

    "For this portion of the exam, please **DO NOT** use your computers, just write your answers with a pen or pencil. You should only spend 10 minutes on this section. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** I recognize it would be easy for you to cheat given you're taking this from home, and as a general policy I will never give you graded closed book exams (it just creates too much pressure to cheat). However, this is NOT an exam, and is not graded, so if you cheat the only person it will hurt is you because it will give us bad information about what you know and don't know, leading to us giving you poor guidance about courses. So please don't cheat!"
